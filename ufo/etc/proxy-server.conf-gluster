# Here you need to add users explicitly. See the OpenStack Swift Deployment
# Guide for more information. The user and user64 directives take the
# following form:
#     user_<account>_<username> = <key> [group] [group] [...] [storage_url]
#     user64_<account_b64>_<username_b64> = <key> [group] [group] [...] [storage_url]
# Where you use user64 for accounts and/or usernames that include underscores.
#
# NOTE (and WARNING): The account name must match the device name specified
# when generating the account, container, and object build rings.
#
# E.g.
#     user_ufo0_admin = abc123 .admin
